# Quantum LCA

Quantum implementation of the forwards LCA. Functions are based on the same methods used in [Equation Expansion Simple Functions](../Equation%20Expansion%20Simple%20Functions) with equation expansion. See the examples there for an example of how simpler equations are expanded out. The Quantum LCA is the same, but using the LCA equations in [Classical LCA](../Classical%20LCA).
